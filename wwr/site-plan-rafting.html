    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[We want our target audience to be families looking for their next adventure. 
    With that in mind, we want to highlight family-friendly trips that emphasize those suitable for families, such as those with lower levels of difficulty and appropriate for children of different ages.
    We want to take advantage of using visual content, implementing engaging photos and videos that showcase families having fun while rafting and provide a glimpse of the natural beauty and excitement of the experience. 
    We also want to use soft, bright colors (blues, yellows, oranges) to give a family-friendly appeal.]</p>
