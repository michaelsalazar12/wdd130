                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return lies the Salmon River. The Salmon River was given the nickname long ago as the "River of No Return" by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                        <br>
                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river, and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine, which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from the sun or rain.
                        <br>
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon River is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. Good rapids are available throughout the summer, but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand dad of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        <br>
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but also with geological wonders and a diverse range of plant and animal life.
                        <br>
                        The rapids in the Grand Canyon use a unique rating scale known as the "X" scale. The rapids are technically rated from X1 to X10 to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I-V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most beautiful desert scenery, Desolation River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swasey's Rapid just outside Green River, Utah, and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, and great whitewater opportunities.
                        <br>
                        Desolation is rated as Class I and is usually done in 5 days.
                        <br>
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
