    <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am from southern California. I returned from serving my mission almost a year ago and I 
    have been givng a lot of thought on what career I would like to pursure once I got home. After much thought and pryaer I decided to go 
    with software/web develpoment and BYU- Idaho has given me the perfect opportunity to do so. I hope to start working in the tech feild within the next year
    and I'm excited to learn and grow this semster!
    </p>
    <p>What I love most about web design and really tech in general is it really gives us the opportunity to express ourselves
        in a way that we have never seen before. Its such a blessing to live in a digital age where we can easily connect
        with one another no matter where we are. I hope that through this career I can help serve others from all around the world!
    </p>
    <p>Some things I love to do duirng free time is read, draw, and spending time outdoors with family.</p>
